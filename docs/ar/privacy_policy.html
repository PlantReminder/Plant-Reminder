    <h2>16. Contact</h2>
    <p>

  <section>
    <h2>17. Biometric Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      Our app offers the option of biometric authentication (such as fingerprint, Face ID, or security code) to
      facilitate access to your account. It is important to note that <strong>we do not store any biometric
        information</strong> nor is it shared with third parties; only the device's operating system is used to securely
      verify your identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      All information used for authentication is managed and stored locally on your device, using the security
      mechanisms provided by the operating system. This ensures your biometric data remains under the exclusive control
      of your device.
